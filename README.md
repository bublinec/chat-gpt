Overview
--------

The ChatGPT CLI tool is a simple, yet powerful command-line interface for users to interact with OpenAI's GPT-4 model. It allows you to send messages to the model and receive responses without the need for a web application or any other user interface. The tool is perfect for developers and hobbyists alike who want to experiment with GPT-4 or integrate it into their projects.
